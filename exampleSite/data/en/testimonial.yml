    content: 'The study of complex adaptive systems from the natural world, systems
      such as swarms of bees, flocks of birds or herds of animals, has illuminated
      how the group as a whole and its members are influenced by, and influence, each
      other. Pursuing questions such as ‘How do birds flock?’ and ‘How do bees swarm?’
      has led scientists to investigate how individual elements act within the context

    content: 'The lens of complex systems science yields insights into facets of forest
      structure and dynamics that facilitate comparisons among ecosystems. These biomes
      share the main properties of complex systems but differ in specific ecological
      properties, disturbance regimes, and human uses. '
